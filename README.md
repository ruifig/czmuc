czmuc is a C++ library with miscellaneous bits of code I tend to use on other projects.
No effort is made to make it easier for other people to use, but feel free to copy whatever you need.

### Exceptions ###

Some portions of czmuc makes use of some other libraries. Check those libraries licenses if you use code that depends on them.
