-----------------
- Check what happens when I call send/receive on disconnected socket.
	- Ideally the handler should still be called from the IOCP (with the appropriate error), to keep behaviour consistent

- Have void RPC also return a reply, so Future<void> actually waits for the RPC to be processed

- Replace typedefs with alias templates, as specified in "Effective Modern C++, Item9 (page 63).
	- Page 66 has good stuff to simplify type traits
